                            <p class="faq-question">Are there any restrictions to selling my Units ?</p>
                            <div class="faq-answer">Units purchased are freehold assets, giving you the flexibility to exit your investment at any time. For each project, we establish a society responsible for managing and maintaining essential common areas, such as borewells, water tanks, access paths, and security. This ensures that all farm plot owners have access to these critical amenities. When a resale occurs, the new purchaser must join the society and obtain the Eco Farm Life Membership. This process is similar to the operations of any other society and is encouraged to ensure the continued benefit and seamless operation for all members.</div>

                            <p class="faq-question">What is the process for reselling the units ?</p>
                            <div class="faq-answer">Reselling your units is straightforward, allowing you to transfer the property to any third party without difficulty. The new owner will automatically join the existing landowners' association and continue the contract with Ameya for the remainder of the term. However, before finalizing the sale, you must ensure that all dues to Ameya are fully paid and obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from an authorized Ameya representative.</div>

                            <p class="faq-question">Can the sandalwood be sold separately by the investor at the time of harvest?</p>
                            <div class="faq-answer">Yes, investors have the option to sell the timber independently of the services provided by Ameya. However, it is essential that the investor ensures no damage is caused to adjacent properties or the larger farmland. The investor must also guarantee the safety and security of all workers on-site and comply with any regulations applicable during the harvest or felling of timber. Additionally, Ameya can assist with the sale of timber at an additional cost if requested by the investor</div>
